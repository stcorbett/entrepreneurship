              In the Conversation - In the Market
            </h3>
            <p>
              A cycle in how I spend time my working on new businesses:
            </p>
            <p>
              I have had phases where I meet a lot of people, build relationships, contribute and recieve contribution.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have had phases where I decline most invitations, am not connecting with new folks nor maintainging existing relationships.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              There is a lot of work to do! Why spend time talking to people, or knowing what is going on in the broader market
              when you have features to build, models to model, concepts to research.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I've recently been in a more connected phase, building context outside of what is immediately applicable for my work right now.
              I'm noticing a few things
              <ul class="">
                <li>
                  There really is a lot happening right now - industries on all scales are growing and shifting in massive ways.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I see many paths and options where I previously saw few.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I am connected in a real way with the growth and shifting around me
                </li>
                <li>
                  I have context in my day-to-day work that fits into a bigger picture
                </li>
              </ul
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, limiting your time forces you to work <b>on</b> your business rather than <b>in</b> your business:
            </p>
            <ul class="">
              <li>
                Building the processes, finding the people, resolving the issues
              </li>
              <li>
                Rather than working inside of a process that is likely not defined,
                scrambing because you have not found the people,
                not knowing why the ends don't meet when you don't have a model that shows the ends should meet
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I see a balanced mode in my future
              - new people and concepts
              - upkeep of valuable existing relationships
              - personal output and contribution in my projects and commitments.
            </p>
            <p>
              We live and work in a continually changing environment - getting exposed to new people and ideas,
              developing skills that don't make money today,
              these actions support your decision making, feed back into opportunities to spend high-value time, and
              create an environment where new options and paths are continually developing.
            </p>
